First experience of the New York cold today. Wearing clothes, and especially layers, protects you well. Where you do feel the cold, is your face. The unprotected part of you, and where you feel the cold, is your face. It bites and it stings. Makes me wish I used the coconut butter this morning instead of ordinary moisturiser. 

There is also a searing breeze blowing between the canyons of the skyscrapers. It's strong enough to blow the tears right out of your eyes. 

Luckily it is a bright and sunny day with a postcard blue sky. I reckon you can get a nice winter tan in this kind of weather. Who cares that it is cold?

As we've been learning all about how to use Photoshop, today's brief was tailored for it. The requirement was to design a wine label for a series of ridiculously named wines. I picked the least silly one. And this is the result. Photoshop montages aren't my thing really, but at least it involved some nice typography (which is my thing).

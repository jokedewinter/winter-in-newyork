First brief that stretched over two days. And it's in colour!
Again very challenging. This time we had to base our design on a random emotion we had to pick without knowing what it was for. I choose "isolated". It's very hard to associate isolation with ice cream, but I got there in the end. And now you know why all the letters are spaced apart. They are isolated from each other.

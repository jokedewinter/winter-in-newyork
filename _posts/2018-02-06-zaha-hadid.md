Create a typeface in one afternoon. Pick a subject, research, draw some letters, stick them in Illustrator and create type. That was today's brief. I wanted something to challenge me and using the architecture of buildings was it. I choose Zaha Hadid's work because it's lovely and tricky to translate into type. 

My typeface is not yet finished (we only had to create enough type to write one word), but I am planning on completing the set. I am nearly halfway.

Everything in America is big. And Mood Fabric on West 37 Street is big. Two floors of row upon row of shelves stacked with rolls of fabric. Organised by fabric type. Including a section for tie fabrics.  

It's a great place, but quite overwhelming - so much choice. Customers appeared to be very knowledgeable about what they wanted. I suspect most of them were either working in fashion or studying fashion.

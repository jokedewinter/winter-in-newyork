Getting into the swing of things and learning about grids and Swiss Graphic Design or the International Design Style. Either way we had to apply our take on it to design an invitation for a museum exhibition.

Alternative idea:
<div class="gallery">
	{% for img in page.gallery %}
	  	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ img }}" alt="">
	{% endfor %}
</div>

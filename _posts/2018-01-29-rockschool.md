The main focus of this leaflet was the typesetting on the inside. The outside was optional if you had time left.
This was an intersting one. After doing our research, finding a direction to design in, creating moodboards and sketches, we were asked to swap our moodboards with someone else. Then we had to design whatever vision we were given from the moodboards of the other person. The moodboards I got were very limited in ideas and direction, but I think I did ok. Pretty pleased with the sound wave idea from the moodboard. Didn't think of that on mine. 

The outside view:
<div class="gallery">
	{% for img in page.gallery %}
	  	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/{{ img }}" alt="">
	{% endfor %}
</div>

	<h1 class="post--title">Ice cream</h1>

	<p>First brief that stretched over two days. And it’s in colour!
Again very challenging. This time we had to base our design on a random emotion we had to pick without knowing what it was for. I choose “isolated”. It’s very hard to associate isolation with ice cream, but I got there in the end. And now you know why all the letters are spaced apart. They are isolated from each other.</p>

				<p>Probably the most challenging brief so far. Mostly because creating that bend in the S in InDesign is very tricky indeed. We haven’t “learned” Illustrator yet, so maybe I can revisit this once we have.</p>

				<p>The main focus of this leaflet was the typesetting on the inside. The outside was optional if you had time left.
This was an intersting one. After doing our research, finding a direction to design in, creating moodboards and sketches, we were asked to swap our moodboards with someone else. Then we had to design whatever vision we were given from the moodboards of the other person. The moodboards I got were very limited in ideas and direction, but I think I did ok. Pretty pleased with the sound wave idea from the moodboard. Didn’t think of that on mine.</p>

		<p>Documenting an adventure in New York.</p>
		<p>I am spending four months braving the New York winter to do the full time Graphic Design course at <a href="https://www.shillingtoneducation.com" rel="external">Shillington</a>. So far the winter is no colder than any other average winter. Those will probably be my famous last words.</p>
